        <h3>My Path</h3>
        <p>Why I Decided to Learn Programming?</p>
		<p>I decided to learn programming when I was 17 years old. I was challenged by my mother to take a risk and complete <br />
		a difficult task without help; something I never thought about doing. Since I could/'t think about anything, I asked my mother to pick.<br />
		About 2hrs later we started watching the movie Swordfish. Later towards the middle of the movie, my mother noticed how Hugh Jackman was <br />
		writing code so she chose programming to be my challenge. I went out and brought my first programming book, "C Programming for the Absolute Beginner.<br />
		As the years went on I later enrolled at Itt-Technical Institute in Duluth, Ga. I made friends who were interested in programming as myself and we agreed<br />
		to challeng each other. The 15th of March was the day we all graduated and thanked each other for pushing one another.</p>
