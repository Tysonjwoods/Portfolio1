   I'm experienced with both software and web development software such as Python, SQL Databases,<br />
   Java, C programming, Visual Studio Asp.net, HTML4& 5, Microsoft Visio, NotePad++, NetBeans, and Eclipse.<br />
   Also with 3 ½ years in database development using SQL. I'm looking for a company where I can develop my <br />
   skills in order to pursue a long-term career. My degree specializes in Information Technology- Software Development.<br />
   With my hands-on experience in the computer labs at ITT Technical Institute it has given me valuable exposure to <br />
   meeting clients’ needs for software applications, web applications, and debugging. My experience in HTML came when <br />
   I was enrolled at ITT Technical Institute. My class training came in the form of making user friendly websites to <br />
   attract users and to get a general ideal of how the code actually works to keep the user interested. Along with my <br />
   web development experience, I most commonly use a SQL Database to store my data. I have gained some valuable skills <br />
   from working in situations requiring communication, team building, and the importance of meeting deadlines. I would <br />
   enjoy an opportunity to utilize my skills and prove to be a valuable asset to your team.
